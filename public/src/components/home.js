              Street art is a form of artwork that is displayed in public on
              surrounding buildings, on streets, trains, and on other publicly
              viewed surfaces. Many instances come in the form of guerrilla art,
              which is intended to make a personal statement about the society
              that the artist lives within. The work has moved from the beginnings
              of graffiti and vandalism to new modes where artists work to bring
              messages, or just beauty, to an audience.

              Slogans of protest and political or social commentary graffiti on
              walls are the precursor to modern graffiti and street art, and
              continue as one aspect of the genre. Street art in the form of text
              or simple iconic graphics of corporate icons can become well-known
              yet enigmatic symbols of an area or an era. Some credit the Kilroy
              Was Here graffiti of the World War II era as one such early example;
              a simple line-drawing of a long-nosed man peering from behind a
              ledge.

              Author Charles Panati indirectly touched upon the general appeal of
              street art in his description of the "Kilroy" graffiti as
              "outrageous not for what it said, but where it turned up". Much of
              what can now be defined as modern street art has well-documented
              origins dating from New York City's graffiti boom, with its infancy
              in the 1960s, maturation in the 1970s, and peaking with the
              spray-painted full-car subway train murals of the 1980s centered in
              the Bronx.

              The northwest wall of the intersection at Houston Street and the
              Bowery in New York City has been a target of artists since the
              1970s. The site, now sometimes referred to as the Bowery Mural,
              originated as a derelict wall that graffiti artists used freely.
              Keith Haring once commandeered the wall for his use in 1982. After
              Haring, a stream of well-known street artists followed, until the
              wall had gradually taken on prestigious status. By 2008, the wall
              became privately managed and made available to artists by commission
              or invitation only.

              Street art has since received artistic recognition with the
              high-profile status of Banksy and other artists. This has led street
              art to become one of the 'sights to see' in many European cities.
              Some artists now provide tours of local street art and can share
              their knowledge, explaining the ideas behind many works, the reasons
              for tagging, and the messages portrayed in a lot of graffiti work.
              Berlin, London, Paris, Hamburg and other cities all have popular
              street art tours running all year round. In London alone there are
              supposedly ten different graffiti tours available for tourists. Many
              of these organizations, such as Alternative London, ParisStreetArt,
              AlternativeBerlin, pride themselves on working with local artists,
              so visitors can get an authentic experience and not just a rehearsed
              script.
